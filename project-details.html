    <h2>Project Overview: House of Rohl</h2>
    <p>
        
For three transformative years, I served as the Interactive Producer for House of Rohl, a distinguished name in luxury kitchen and bath design. My focus was on delivering innovative digital and social assets that aligned seamlessly with the brandâ€™s storytelling approach, notably during the "Life Well Crafted" campaign.

With deep knowledge of brand identity, platforms, motion and custom coding projects, and a clear understanding of consumer- and designer-focused messaging, I effectively bridged creative and technical teams to produce compelling digital experiences.
