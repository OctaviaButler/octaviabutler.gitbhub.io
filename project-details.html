            <h2>Project Overview: House of Rohl</h2>
            <p>
                For three transformative years, I served as the Interactive Producer for House of Rohl, a distinguished name in luxury kitchen and bath design. My focus was on delivering innovative digital and social assets that aligned seamlessly with the brand’s storytelling approach, notably during the "Life Well Crafted" campaign.
                With deep knowledge of brand identity, platforms, motion, and custom coding projects, and a clear understanding of consumer- and designer-focused messaging, I effectively bridged creative and technical teams to produce compelling digital experiences.
